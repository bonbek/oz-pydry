# Rain in Australia

## Presentation

This repository contains the code for our project _O'Z PyDry_, developed during our [Data Scientist training](https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course) at [DataScientest](https://datascientest.com/).

The goal of this project is to predict the next rain day in Australia by training classification model.

This project was developed by the following team :

- Aalae Benki ([GitHub](https://github.com/abenki87) / [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aalae-Benki))
- Romaric Reynier ([GitHub](https://github.com/Romaric-Reynier) / [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/romaric-reynier-069ab617b))

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Streamlit App

To run the app :

```shell
cd streamlit_app
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run Introduction.py
```

The app should then be available at [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
